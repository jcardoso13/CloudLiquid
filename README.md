# Cloud Liquid Framework

CloudLiquid is a versatile framework designed to facilitate the parsing of data from HTTP content or strings containing JSON, CSV, and XML data into objects that other projects can utilize. Originally developed to work with CloudLiquid and LiquidConsole or Transform-Data-Functions, it plays a crucial role in transforming payloads into suitable formats for various templating engines. For DotLiquid, it converts payloads into Hash objects (Dictionary<string, object>), and for Scriban, it transforms payloads into ScriptObjects.

## Features
- Data Parsing: Easily parse JSON, CSV, and XML data into Hash objects.
- Integration with Templating Engines: Expanding DotLiquid for transforming payloads.
- Flexible Content Factory: Utilize the ContentFactory module for advanced data handling and transformations.

## Getting Started
To get started with CloudLiquid, clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/jcardoso13/CloudLiquid.git
```
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and follow the setup instructions detailed in the AzureCloudLiquid README.

## Usage
CloudLiquid can be integrated into your projects to parse and transform data from various formats. See the documentation within the ContentFactory module for specific usage examples and advanced features.
