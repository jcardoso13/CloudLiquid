# CloudLiquid

This is the Library/API to use for the extended dotLiquid Template Language. It has extra filters and tags that are useful in Cloud Scenarios for Data Transformation.


In the future, the goal of this repo is to have the necessary filters and tags to be used in Azure,AWS,CGP and On-Prem services.


This is a lib project so it's not a runnable project. It's used by other repos that implement an  Azure Functions, GCP Function,AWS Lambda or a bash interface: LiquidConsole.
